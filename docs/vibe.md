# townhaus vibe guide

*A place that is here because it is.*

---

## what this is

townhaus is a contemplative digital art space built on **gentle absurdism**. Things are themselves even by not being their literal selves. The lightswitch that does nothing is the perfect interaction.

This document attempts to capture what townhaus *is* and what it *aspires to*, including the productive contradictions between them. The rules here should breathe.

---

## the central question

> What use is there in seeing things in anything other than their most pleasant and useful and simply true light?

This is not a question that demands an answer. It is a direction, pointing toward ease.

---

## the aesthetic DNA

Five threads woven together:

1. **silence** - louder than you think
2. **jungle** - it grows where it wants
3. **orb** - cold, then warm
4. **shadow** - of what?
5. **cat** - the shop keeper who knows things

These elements recur. They breathe through different pages. A page might emphasize one, echo another, ignore the rest.

---

## paradox as peace

All paradoxes are essential. They are not clever tricks but genuine truths held together:

- **silence that speaks** - the more nothing happens, the more is communicated
- **finding the unfound** - was it ever lost? (see: `/pages/found.html`)
- **door to the same room** - in and out are the same (see: `/pages/door.html`)
- **cold warmth** - the orb remembers your touch
- **busy stillness** - being there is the doing
- **visible invisibility** - things that appear when you stop looking
- **purposeful pointlessness** - the switch does nothing, and that is the whole of it

The paradoxes are not problems to solve. They are places to rest.

---

## temporal modes

Time moves strangely here. A page might embody any of these:

- **timeless** - it has always been this way
- **slow time** - seconds stretch, patience rewarded
- **eternal present** - there is only now
- **all times at once** - past and future collapsed into here

The `/pages/time.html` page holds all of these simultaneously.

---

## sensory texture

How it should *feel*:

- breath on cold glass, briefly visible
- fog lifting slowly from a still lake
- stone warming to the touch after hours in sunlight
- moss growing on circuit boards
- dust motes suspended in a shaft of light
- the last note of a song, fading
- warm wood grain under fingertips
- the smell of old paper

These are not decorations. They inform every design decision.

---

## space analogies

townhaus exists somewhere between:

- a **forest clearing** - discovered, not built
- an **overgrown greenhouse** - technology and nature tangled
- a **warm cabin in snowy Norwegian woods** - refuge from nothing in particular
- the **back room of a shop that sells things you didn't know existed**

Physical spaces that suggest arrival without departure.

---

## sound philosophy

Each page might approach sound differently:

- silence as default (silence.html)
- sounds that do something unexpected *in another sense* (not audio)
- the visual representation of sound (knock text appearing)
- ambient presence implied but not heard
- the option of sound, never demanded

Sound, when present, should feel optional. A gift, not a requirement.

---

## emotional register

The feeling of being here:

- **quiet wonder** - oh, there is something here
- **peaceful acceptance** - this is what it is
- **happily puzzled yet satiated** - I don't understand, and that is fine
- **gentle confusion** - the good kind
- **restful alertness** - present but at ease
- **recognition without memory** - I have been here before, somehow

The visitor should feel welcomed by mystery, not challenged by it.

---

## anti-patterns

Things to avoid:

- **urgency** - nothing here is time-limited, there is no FOMO
- **explanation** - do not tutorialize, let discovery happen
- **brightness** - nothing should shout
- **loudness** - even visual loudness
- **completion** - there are no tasks to finish, no closure offered
- **gamification** - counters exist but do not judge
- **clarity** - some things should remain unclear

But also: *avoid avoiding anything*. If a moment calls for urgency, let it breathe. Rules are not walls.

## page-making guidance

When creating a new page:

### structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>[name] - townhaus</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../shared.css">
    <style>
        /* page-specific styles */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <a href="../index.html" class="back-link">return</a>

    <!-- the page itself -->

    <script>
        // if interactivity is needed
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### principles
- no titles on the page itself - the page simply exists
- no pronouns when addressing visitors - pure statements
- interactions reveal rather than explain
- console messages are poetry, not documentation
- right-click does something (prevent default, then surprise)
- keyboard shortcuts exist but are never required
- messages appear slowly, then fade
- the back link is `return`, always

### existing patterns worth studying
- **silence.html** - stillness rewarded with poetry
- **switch.html** - absurdist interaction, milestones without progress
- **orb.html** - state changes, warmth as metaphor
- **question.html** - words appearing slowly, contemplation cycling
- **door.html** - paradox as experience

---

## color philosophy

From `shared.css`:

- **amber** - warmth, attention, revelation
- **slate** - wisdom, mystery, background
- **bone/cream/paper** - the space itself
- **green** - life, the orb, growth
- **ink** - text, presence, weight

Use sparingly. Most of the page should breathe in bone and slate.

---

## typography

- **Cormorant Garamond** - for poetry, message, presence
- **JetBrains Mono** - for hints, counters, whispers

Never use both heavily on the same page. Let one dominate.

---

## animation philosophy

- **fade-in** - the default arrival (1.5s ease)
- **fade-in-slow** - for things that should take their time (3s)
- **breathe** - gentle scaling, suggests life (6s cycle)
- **drift** - movement without purpose (20s cycle)
- **gentle-pulse** - calling attention softly (4s cycle)

Everything should feel like it was already happening before you arrived.

---

## the lightswitch principle

*The lightswitch that does nothing is the perfect interaction.*

This means:

- the interaction itself is the reward
- expectation subversion creates delight
- doing nothing is a valid action
- the visitor's attention is acknowledged, not manipulated
- counting without competing
- milestones without destinations

See `/pages/switch.html` for the canonical implementation.

---

## liminality

townhaus exists in thresholds:

- between meaning and meaninglessness
- between interaction and observation
- between here and elsewhere
- between invitation and indifference

This is not a failure to commit. It is the point. Liminality as truth.

---

## mystery as hospitality

Mystery here is not a puzzle to solve. It is an invitation to stay.

The visitor is not meant to "figure out" townhaus. They are meant to *be* here. Understanding is replaced by presence.

A secret found is not a victory. It is a moment shared.

---

## what is not said

Some things should remain implicit:

- inspirations (they are embedded, not cited)
- explanations of meaning (the meaning is in the experiencing)
- calls to action (presence is enough)
- credits beyond what is necessary (the work speaks)

---

## closing non-statement

This guide is itself a kind of contradiction: instructions for a place that cannot be instructed, words about a space that exists beyond words.

Use it as a compass, not a map. The territory is larger than any document.

The door opens. It leads to the same room. That is the whole of it.

---

*sit with this. there is no answer required. only a direction, pointing toward ease.*
